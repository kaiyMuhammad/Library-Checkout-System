# Library-Checkout-System
This is my Intermediate Java final project from Summer 2019.

The requirements were to use: recursion, a searching algorithm, a sorting algorithm, abstract data types, polymorphism, and the graphical user interface.

Inside the PDF is a breakdown of each component in the program and the diffficulties I had making it.
